						<p>Hi! We're Becca and Brian! We believe that God's church
							should be the most welcoming and supportive place on Earth
							for people with disabilities. Some temporal places are still more
							inclusive right now, but Christ asked His disciples,
							"What do ye more than others?" (Matthew 5:47) and we want 
							to have a better answer to that question.
						</p>
						<p>Joseph Smith said "All the minds and spirits that God ever sent into 
							the world are susceptible of enlargement." and Elder Marion D. Hanks 
							continued, "It came to me forcefully that God expects that His 
							handicapped children will be given an opportunity for that enlargement, 
							and that His disciples will accept the great responsibility to be 
							concerned that they are."</p>
						<p>If you have a disability, you aren't a placeholder that just need
							to be stewarded until the next life. You can learn and grow
							in ways that work for you, and we can support you in 
							strengthening you agency and testimony. We hope these resources
							can improve people's mindset and 
							understanding of some of the Lord's lost sheep.
						</p>
