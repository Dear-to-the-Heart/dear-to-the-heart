<h2>How to Help</h2>

<h3><a href="/surveys">Surveys</a></h3>
<p>Disability experiences can vary quite a bit by region
									and even by ward. We are collecting feedback on what is
									and isn't working so we can all learn together how best
									to support people with disabilities.</p>

<h3><a href="/church/lesons">Teaching Strategies</a></h3>
<p>A combination of general strategies and weekly Come Folloe Me
									suggestions to help make your lessons more inclusive.</p>

<h3><a href="/videos">Clips to Make You Think</a></h3>
<p>A mix of humor and heart to help change your head. It's ok if supporting
									people with disabilities doesn't come naturally to you, but that doesn't 
									mean you can't make a difference!</p>
