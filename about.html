<p>A little backstory.</p>

<p>Becca is our oldest kid, and she was born with something called Rett Syndrome.
It's a genetic mutation that results in a primarily neurological condition. Basically
it's not as easy for signals to get from her brain to the rest of her body. She
thinks just like anybody else.</p>

<p>Rett Syndrome has made a lot of things harder for Becca, but a few years ago, 
when her body became a bit more stable, she decided she wanted to start advocating.
Becca is passionate about empowering every person to make choices for themselves.</p>

<p>Becca has had a mix of church experiences. She had some great, meaningful 
  experiences, and some that were not handled well. That's probably true for
  everybody, but the ratio is usually a lot different for people with disabilities.
  Becca advocates because she wants things to be easier for the next person. We
  are both doing this because, as a church, we still have room to improve.
</p>

<p>As her dad, I'm happy to help support Becca in her advocacy work. I spent years 
working in the educational technology sector, and then moved to disability 
technology. I've worked with teaching and learning, and disability experts
and advocates on lots of different projects. Advocacy is something new for
both of us, so we're figuring it out as we go.</p>
