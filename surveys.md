<h2>Surveys</h2>

<p>
  The following survey is for individuals with a disability or their family members.
  Our goal is to help make church attendance one of the most inclusive experiences
  available for people with disabilities. To help make that happen we are hoping to 
  learn what things are like right now. Too often successes aren't able to be
  repeated and mistakes aren't learned from. We hope to change that!
</p>
<p>If you know anyone from church who could participate in the survey, with any degree of disability in their family, please share this link!
