<h2>Ordinances for People with Disabilities </h2>

<p>Church ordinances can be a bit tricky for people with disabilities.
  The scriptures teach that baptism is not required
  for those who are not accountable. But measuring accountability isn't
  always possible.
</p>

<p>Some families report needing to wait for "the right Bishop" before their
  child could be baptized. Some were told by a bishop that their child would "never"
  be baptized. Many bishops are willing to meet with families and people
  with disabilities to understand their specific situation and support them
  when there is a desire to perform saving ordinances.
</p>

<h3>Strategies for Preparation</h3>
<p>The primary prerequisite for baptism is a desire to follow Christ. If your
  child has independently expressed a desire to be baptized, then there 
  is probably a way to make it happen.
</p>
<p>Additionally, you may need to help ward leadership accept and understand 
  your child's accountability. If they see your child participate in Primary,
  including giving prayers or sharing scriptures, or if your child is willing
  to bear their testimony in Sacrament Meeting, it may help others recognize
  your child's level of understanding. None of these things are in any way
  require for baptism, and I wouldn't recommend pressuring your child if 
  they are uncomfortalbe. Other approaches to awareness could include 
  them making cards for church leaders or you sharing personal spiritual 
  experiences you've had with your child on a regular basis.
</p>
<p>Baptism must be performed by immersion, and the handbook states that white
  clothing is required for the baptizer and baptizee, but church-provided
  jumpsuits are not necessary, just convenient. Only two witnesses are
  required, and a whole program is not necessary if that won't work for your child.
</p>
<p>I have heard mention of something called "baptism by proxy for the living"
  where, with First Presidency approval, someone can act as a proxy for a person
  who would not be able to be baptized for themself. This is not in the handbook
  and was shared with me secondhand, by someone who was told by a church representative, so that's all I can say about it for now.
</p>

<h3>Other Ordinances</h3>
<p>There are many accommodations possible for temple ordinances, for those
  who have received a temple recommend. Church leaders will expect a higher
  degree of understanding (and possibly interaction) before granting a
  temple recommend. But there are youth with autism, Down Syndrome, Rett
  Syndrome, etc. who regularly perform baptisms for the dead.</p>

<p>When attending for baptisms for the dead, people with disabilities are not 
  required to participate in both baptism and confirmation. They can act
  as witnesses for the baptism. If they cannot easily be baptized themselves, they
  can perform confirmations for temple-provided names, or have someone else perform
  the baptism portion for them.
</p>
<p>NOTE: We have had trouble with some temple
  coordinators not wanting to allow a stand-in for the baptism portion if the stand-in
  is also doing their own names because that would be "too many" names for one person (they have a hard time remembering that it's for two people not just one).
  Our current strategy is to just tell the coordinator that Becca and her sister will both be doing names, and leave the stand-in discussion for the font area.
</p>
<p>Other temple ordinances are also regularly accommodated for. There are senior
  church members who attend the temple regularly who cannot get out of a wheelchair, or who cannot speak anymore, so there are accommodations in place that will work for
  many disabilities. You can always call the temple presidency and ask if you have
  more specific questions.
