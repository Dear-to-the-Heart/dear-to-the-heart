<h2>Inclusive Come Follow Me</h2>

The Church encourages inclusion rather than separate
disability classrooms or ministries. This means that your classroom has the
potential to be the most inclusive place some of your students 
experience each week. If you take a few minutes to prepare with them
in mind, and direct a portion of your lesson toward their personal
growth, you will already be ahead of what most people with disabilities
experience in their school and community. But let's not stop there!

<h3>Weekly Lessons</h3>

<p>The Come Follow Me lessons are a great way to organize and prepare for
  teaching in church. If you don't have a lot of practice supporting people
  with disabilities, then you may need additional resources than what's 
  available in Gospel Library. Worry not! We have activity and discussion
  ideas that can help make sure your classroom is inclusive while
  still supporting *all* of your students.
