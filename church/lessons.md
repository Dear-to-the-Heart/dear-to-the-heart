<h2>Inclusive Come Follow Me</h2>

The Church encourages inclusion rather than separate
disability classrooms or ministries.

<h3>Weekly Lessons</h3>

<p>The Come Follow Me lessons are a great way to organize and prepare for
  teaching in church. If you don't have a lot of practice supporting people
  with disabilities, then you may need additional resources than what's 
  available in Gospel Library. Worry not! We have activity and discussion
  ideas that can help make sure your classroom is inclusive while
  still supporting *all* of your students.
