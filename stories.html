<h2>Disability Stories</h2>

<p>As part of our work, we try to meet with other families
  in the church where someone has a disability. We do this to learn 
  what's worked other places, and to try to generalize what we've
  learned on our own to help more people.
</p>

<h3>Mystery Activities</h3>

<p>One family shared that their stake would hold quarterly youth activites,
  but that the plan for the activity was kept under wraps because youth
  wouldn't be as likely to come if they knew what was happening.
</p>
<p>For people with disabilities, it can take significant planning and preparation
  just to attend what might seem like a typical activity at the church
  building. People with autism or anxiety may not feel comfortable coming at all
  if they don't know what to expect. <b>If it's important to keep the activity
  a surprise from most of the youth, it still makes sense to share the agenda 
  with ward leaders so they can selectively share it with those members who
  will have a better experience with a little preparation.</b>
</p>

<h3>Church Outside of Church</h3>
<p>A family shared that their disabled son wasn't comfortable attending class
  in the church classrooms anymore, and that he'd rather stay at home. The 
  Young Men leaders responded by coordinating with the family and agreeing
  to hold class in this young man's living room instead of at the church.
</p>
<p>Sometimes supporting people with disabilities means thinking outside the
  box. There are very few absolutes in the church, and in fact the scriptures
  are chock full of exceptions to people's expectations. <b>When you focus on how
  to support each individual as a person deserving God's love, you'll find
  it easier to come up with ideas how to minister to them.</b>
</p>

  and to help others learn how we can all improve.
